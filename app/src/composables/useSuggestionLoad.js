   *    If API response is valid, it stores the model in vuex state inside
   *    sectionSuggestions state variable, fetches corresponding page metadata
   *    for source article and returns the model.
   * 3. If the API response is empty then the suggestion to be loaded is a page
   *    suggestion. To support this case, page metadata are fetched and a page
   *    suggestion is stored inside vuex pageSuggestions state variable. Finally,
   *    a new sectionSuggestion model is created and returned to support creation
   *    of new article by translating the lead section.
   * If page metadata cannot be loaded, an Error with appropriate message
   * is being thrown.
